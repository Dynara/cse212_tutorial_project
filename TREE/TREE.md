# TREE

A `tree` is a hierarchial data structure that consists on nodes connected by edges. 
The top node is called the root node. Nodes that connect to no other node are called leaf nodes. Parent nodes have nodes connected to it. The nodes to the left and right of any parent node are child nodes. Each node can have zero or more child nodes. There is always only one root node.

## Types of Trees
`Binary tree`: This is a tree that links to no more than two other nodes. 

`Binary Search Tree` (BST): this is a node-based binary tree. The way the BST works is that the left subtree of a node only contains nodes with keys that are lesser than the node's key. The right subtree of the node only contains nodes with keys that are greater than the node's key. There are also no duplicate nodes.
